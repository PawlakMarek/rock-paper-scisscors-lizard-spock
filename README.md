# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors, expanded with the additional choices of Lizard and Spock. It's a console-based game where you play against the computer.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PawlakMarek/rock-paper-scisscors-lizard-spock.git
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:** 
   * You'll be presented with the game rules and a list of choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock).
   * Enter the number corresponding to your chosen weapon.
   * The computer will make a random choice.
   * The winner of each round is determined based on the game rules.
   * The first player to reach 3 wins is declared the overall winner.

## Project Status

This project is a checkpoint submission for the "The Legend of Python" course on [Codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io/python). It demonstrates my understanding of basic Python concepts like:

* Input/output
* Variables
* Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
* Loops (while)
* Random number generation

## Future Improvements

* **Refactoring with functions:**  Once I learn about functions, I plan to refactor the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain.
* **Error handling:** I'd like to add more robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid user input.
* **Graphical user interface:**  In the future, I might explore creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.

I'm open to any suggestions or improvements! Feel free to create an issue or pull request.
